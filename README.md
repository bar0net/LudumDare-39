They Come At Night is a tower defence game where you, not only need to deal with the monsters that would try to attack the city every night, but also manage how you allocate your power to avoid running out of energy to keep your defences firing!

===========================================================

Made in 48-hours from the Ludum Dare Compo by Jordi Tudela Alcacer using:
- Unity 5.6.0f3 
- Photoshop
- Audition
- IPython Notebook and [music21 toolkit](http://web.mit.edu/music21/)

===========================================================

# Directions

The game is divided into two segments:
- **Daytime:** nothing major happens here. Every morning, your generating buildings earn you more power and the surviving population will pay you some taxes. **When you are ready, press the sun-button (low-right of the screen) to advance time until night**
- **Nighttime:** The monsters will attack!


- You can build on green tiles
- You can use the light bulb buttons to power up or down any tower to try to make a more efficient use of your available power
- You can speed up or slow the game using the time controls on the upper-left part of the screen

============================================================
